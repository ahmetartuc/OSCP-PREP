# OSCP-PREP

While preparing for OSCP I solved over 200 machines across different platforms. I started with Hack The Box working on machines of varying difficulty to build a strong foundation. Then, I watched S1REN’s Vulnhub walkthroughs (yup, I took notes with screenshots of every step, including mistakes as if I were solving the machine side by side) which helped me improve my techniques and extend my understanding. PG Practice is a must if you’re serious about OSCP—it offers machines that closely resemble the exam format and are incredibly useful for learning. If you’re aiming to go beyond OSCP, I highly recommend diving into the ProLabs on Hack The Box. They’ll help you take your skills and practical knowledge to the next level.

Good luck with your OSCP journey and happy 24h hacking!
